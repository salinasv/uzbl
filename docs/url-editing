* All url changing/editing happens outside of uzbl

Use cases:
* load url from history/bookmarks (dmenu-vertical is great for this)
* edit current url or one from history/bookmarks: dmenu-vertical is relatively good for this, though it would be better if we had:
- minimal editing helper key shortcuts (eg to go to beginning/end of input buffer, erase search string, undo)
- copy/paste support

* Though you can obviously type new urls and edit the current ones with the appropriate statusbar stuff/binds/xclip commands, this is sometimes enough.
